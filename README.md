# Crocc

Crocc is a simple static-site generator based on Markdown.
The main goal of Crocc is to offer simplicity, as opposed to other static-site
generation tools such as Hugo or Jekyll.
Indeed, you only need Markdown to write content in a productive manner, and
everything else is standard scripts (JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.).
