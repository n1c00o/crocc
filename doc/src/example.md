# Example

First, make sure you have Crocc installed on your system.
If not, see the [installation](/#installation) page.

Now, let's create a new Crocc website:

First, create a new Crocc project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-website
```

The `my-website` directory will contains all the file composing the site.

Inside this directory, create a `.crocc.html` file.
This file contains the HTML template used to generate HTML documents.
For example, you can use the following template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>{{ .Title }}</title>
	<meta name="description" content="{{ .Description }}">
	<meta name="keywords" content="{{ .Keywords }}">
	<meta name="author" content="{{ .Author }}">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
</head>
<body>
	{{ .Content }}
</body>
</html>
```

> More information about the template syntax can be found in the 
> [template documentation](/doc/templates) page.

Then, create a `index.md` file next to the template file.
Each Markdown file will be converted to an HTML file.

```markdown

description: This is my website.

# My website

This is my website.
```

Every Markdown file must have a header containing metadata about the document.
This header is known as YAML front matter. More information about it are
available in the [front matter documentation](/doc/markdown) page.

Before building the website, we need to create a `style.css` file in the
source directory.
As with other non-Markdown file, this file will be directly copied to the
output directory.

```css
body {
	font-family: sans-serif;
	color: #f2c933; /* yellow-ish */
	background-color: #1f1f1f; /* dark grey */
}
```

Now, we can build the website:

```bash
$ crocc -out=dist -url="https://example.com" my-website
```

The `-out` flag specifies the output directory, and the `-url` flag specifies
the base URL of the website.

The `dist` directory now contains the generated website:

You can now serve the `dist` directory with your favorite web server.
Here is the `index.html` file generated by Crocc:

## Conclusion

This example is very simple, but it shows the main features of Crocc.
For more information, see the [documentation](/doc) page.

This website itself is built with Crocc, and its source code is available
[here](https://github.com/n1c00o/crocc/tree/master/doc/).
